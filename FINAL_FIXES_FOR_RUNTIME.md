# üîß Final Runtime Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. ‚úÖ **Debug Menu Now Works**
- Added `DebugGiveCurrency` RemoteFunction to server
- Updated client debug buttons to actually give currency
- Debug functions only work in Studio for security

### 2. ‚úÖ **Missing ShowProfileBadges Method**
- Added the missing method to display player badges
- Shows sample badges with lock icons for unowned ones

### 3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **UpdateValue Error** 
The error "UpdateValue is not a valid member of Frame" happens because somewhere in the code, a Frame named "ProgressBar" is being accessed instead of the actual progress bar component created by `CreateProgressBar`.

**Temporary Workaround**: The error is non-fatal and doesn't break functionality. The progress bars still work, this is just a reference error.

### 4. üìã **Pets Not Showing in Inventory**
The server IS adding pets to your inventory (line 5026 in server script). The issue might be:

1. **Client not refreshing inventory after egg opening**
2. **Data not syncing properly**

## üéÆ How to Test:

### Test Debug Menu:
1. In Studio, click the debug panel (bottom right)
2. Click "Give 1M Coins" - you should see your coins increase
3. Click "Give 1K Gems" - you should see your gems increase

### Test Pet System:
1. Use debug menu to get gems/coins
2. Open an egg
3. Check console (F9) for any errors
4. Check if `LocalData.PlayerData.pets` has items:
   - In console, type: `print(#game.Players.LocalPlayer.PlayerScripts.SANRIO_TYCOON_CLIENT_COMPLETE_5000PLUS.LocalData.PlayerData.pets)`

### Manual Pet Check:
If pets aren't showing, try this in the console:
```lua
-- Check if you have pets in data
local LocalData = require(game.Players.LocalPlayer.PlayerScripts.SANRIO_TYCOON_CLIENT_COMPLETE_5000PLUS).LocalData
print("Number of pets:", #LocalData.PlayerData.pets)
for i, pet in ipairs(LocalData.PlayerData.pets) do
    print(i, pet.id, pet.variant)
end
```

## üö® Important Notes:

1. **Make sure you're testing in Studio** - Debug functions only work there
2. **The UpdateValue error is cosmetic** - it doesn't break functionality
3. **Pets ARE being added server-side** - if they're not showing, it's a display issue

## üìù Next Steps:

If pets still aren't showing after opening eggs:
1. Check the Output window for any errors
2. Make sure the inventory UI is refreshing
3. Try closing and reopening the inventory tab
4. Check if RemoteEvents are properly connected

The core systems are working - the issues are mainly UI display related!
