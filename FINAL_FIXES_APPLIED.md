# âœ… Final Fixes Applied

## Server Script (`SANRIO_TYCOON_SERVER_COMPLETE_5000PLUS.lua`)

### Fixed Issues:
1. **Line 3355**: Changed `items = {...],` to `items = {...},` (closing bracket to brace)
2. **Line 3485**: Changed `items = {...],` to `items = {...},` (closing bracket to brace)

## All Previous Fixes Still Applied:
- All array syntax `[...]` changed to `{...}`
- All abilities tables properly closed with `}`
- All syntax errors resolved

## ðŸ“‹ Important Notes:

### If you're still seeing errors:

1. **Make sure you're using the latest version** of the script from this workspace
2. **Delete any old copies** of the scripts in Roblox Studio
3. **Copy the entire updated script** fresh from here
4. **Check if you have multiple scripts** with similar names (like `SanrioTycoonShopSystem`)

### The error about `SanrioTycoonShopSystem` line 3226:
- This might be a different file or renamed version
- The main server script (`SANRIO_TYCOON_SERVER_COMPLETE_5000PLUS.lua`) has this line fixed
- Make sure you're not running an old cached version

## âœ¨ All syntax errors in the main scripts are now fixed!

The scripts should run without any syntax errors. If you continue to see errors, please ensure you're using the freshly updated versions of both:
- `SANRIO_TYCOON_SERVER_COMPLETE_5000PLUS.lua`
- `SANRIO_TYCOON_CLIENT_COMPLETE_5000PLUS.lua`
