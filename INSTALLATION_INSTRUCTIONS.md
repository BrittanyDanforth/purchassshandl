- ClanCreated/Invite
- QuestsUpdated/Completed
- AchievementUnlocked
- DailyRewardClaimed

## 🖥️ Client Script (Coming Next)
This is ONLY the server script. You still need:
1. A client-side UI script (LocalScript)
2. GUI elements for the shop interface
3. Visual effects and animations

The server is ready to handle all logic - the client just needs to create the visual interface!

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **This is a SERVER script** - It goes in ServerScriptService, NOT StarterGui
2. **No UI Code** - All UI must be created separately in a client script
3. **Auto-creates RemoteEvents** - Don't create them manually
4. **Requires HTTP Service** - For generating unique IDs
5. **Group Benefits** - Update GROUP_ID for group bonuses

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "HTTP Service not enabled"
- Game Settings > Security > Enable HTTP Service

### "DataStore not working"
- Make sure you're testing in a published place
- Enable API Services in Game Settings

### "RemoteEvents not found"
- The script creates them automatically
- Check ReplicatedStorage > RemoteEvents folder

### Yellow underlines in script
- These are just Roblox Studio warnings
- The script will still work properly

## 📞 Support
If you have issues:
1. Check the Output window for errors
2. Make sure all services are enabled
3. Verify the script is in ServerScriptService
4. Ensure HTTP Service is enabled

5. Connect UI to server via RemoteEvents

Good luck with your Sanrio Tycoon Shop! 🎮✨
