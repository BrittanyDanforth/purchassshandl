}
```

    Gem = "rbxassetid://10000000002",
    -- etc...
}
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Server Required** - This UI won't work without the server script
2. **LocalScript Only** - Must be in StarterPlayerScripts
3. **Auto-scales** - UI automatically adjusts to screen size
4. **Settings Save** - Player settings are saved to server

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "UI doesn't appear"
- Check that the server script is installed
- Make sure the script is in StarterPlayerScripts
- Check output for errors

### "Buttons don't work"

### "Missing images/sounds"
