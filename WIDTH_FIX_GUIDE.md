# üéØ SANRIO TYCOON CLIENT - WIDTH FIX v7.2

## üí° THE REAL ISSUE

The UIs weren't positioned wrong - they were TOO WIDE!

- Navigation bar: 80 pixels wide
- MainPanel: Already positioned at x=80 to avoid navigation
- **Problem**: UIs were using `size = UDim2.new(1, -20, 1, -90)` (FULL WIDTH)
- **Solution**: Use fixed 800x600 size, centered in MainPanel

## üì• QUICK INSTALL

1. Delete old SanrioTycoonClient
2. Create new Script: `SanrioTycoonClient`
3. Copy contents from `WIDTH_FIX_CLIENT.lua`
4. Run game

## ‚úÖ WHAT THIS FIXES

1. **UI Width** - All UIs now use 800x600 standard size
2. **Centering** - UIs centered in MainPanel, not full width
3. **No Overlap** - Fixed width means no overlap with navigation
4. **Case Opening** - TextTransparency error fixed
5. **All Previous Fixes** - DataCache, dropdowns, etc.

## üß™ TESTING

```lua
-- Check UI sizes
_G.SanrioTycoonClient.Debug.PrintSizes()

-- Fix any that are still wrong
_G.SanrioTycoonClient.Debug.FixWidths()

-- Test UIs
_G.SanrioTycoonClient.Debug.TestShop()
_G.SanrioTycoonClient.Debug.TestInventory()
```

## üìè STANDARD SIZES

- **Navigation**: 80px wide (left side)
- **MainPanel**: Starts at x=80, full remaining width
- **UI Windows**: 800x600, centered in MainPanel
- **Result**: No overlap, professional look

## üéÆ EXPECTED BEHAVIOR

When you open any UI:
- It appears centered in the main area
- Fixed 800x600 size (not full width)
- Doesn't overlap navigation buttons
- Can still see and click navigation

This matches how the Shop works - fixed size, centered, no overlap!
